# indesign-api-docs

## General Setup and OnBoarding
1. Create IMS client_id via ims service tool (https://imss.corp.adobe.com) - You need to add "indesign_services" as scope to this client ID.
2. You need to reach out to the Cloud Extensibility team cxp-engg@adobe.com, to whitelist your client_id.
Above mentioned APIs are exposed through AdobeIO, client teams would have to onboard to AdobeIO as Consumer Application and subscribe to "Cloud Extensibility Platform".  (Whitelisting API Keys - Subscribe API Keys to Services)

After step 1, you will have your client_id and client_secret.

use these to make a curl request to IMS
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/token/v1' \
--header 'Cookie: relay=62669f22-9569-4355-a801-0f7fb917afdf; ftrset=380' \
--form 'grant_type="authorization_code"' \
--form 'client_id="IDCloudService2"' \
--form 'client_secret="xxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx"' \
--form 'code="Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN>"' \
--form 'scope="indesign_services"'
```

after the successfull completion of the above request, 
you will get the 'access_token' in response.
Use this bearer token further in your API calls.
This will be valid for 24hrs, then you need to refresh it.

## API Keys

Also known as the client_id. You must additionally pass in your Adobe API key in the x-api-key header field. Youâ€™ll automatically get a developer API key when you create your Adobe I/O Console Integration. After you've created your integration you can find your API key in the Overview tab of your Integration

## Retries

The service will retry status codes of 429, 502, 503, 504 three times.
You should only retry requests that have a 5xx response code. A 5xx error response indicates there was a problem processing the request on the server.
You should implement an exponential back-off retry strategy with 3 retry attempts.
You should not retry requests for any other response code.
Rate Limiting

**We have not put a throttle limit on requests to the API at this time.

# InDesign

## General Workflow

INDESIGN workflows information - a brief

## Input and Output file storage

Clients can use assets stored on one of the following storage types:

1. Adobe: by referencing the path to the files on Creative Cloud
2. External: (like AWS S3) by using a presigned GET/PUT URL

# Links 
Links is one of the most important feature of InDesign. You can place and link content within the same document or even across different documents. This also helps in keeping the assets and the document decoupled. Links can be correponding to texts, graphics etc. 

InDesign APIs support the processing of documents with links. To process a request a temporary folder/diretory is created. This directory is called the working directory for the req. In the request all the assets mentioned in the request are downloaded and kept in the working directory. Within the working directory the location of individual asset is governed by the relative path mentioned in the assets[i]/destination. To refer to the same asset in the rest of the params, the value mentioned in the destination property is to be used.

## Fonts 
Like Links fonts are very important. The support of fonts is as follows:
### Adobe fonts
Adobe fonts are also supported. These are fetched automatically on the behalf of the requestor and thus nothing needs to be done while making a request. Please not that the list of supported fonts is dependent on the requestor's account.
### Custom fonts
Custom fonts or user fonts can be provided as a a regular link. For the fonts to be picked properly, please place it in the "Document Fonts" folder parallel to the document which uses it.
