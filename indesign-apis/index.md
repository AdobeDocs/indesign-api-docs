# Adobe InDesign API - Firefly Services

Unlock the potential of Adobe InDesign APIs through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Overview

InDesign APIs enable enterprises to automate tedious, time-consuming
design tasks through scalable cloud services, driving personalization at
scale, creative automation, and faster content delivery. Built on
RESTful principles, these APIs use standard HTTP response codes,
methods, and authentication techniques to deliver responses in JSON
format.

The InDesign APIs comprise of the following:

-   [Rendition](#linktorendition) API to create renditions of
    a file in either PNG, JPG, or PDF format.

-   [Data Merge API](#working-with-data-merge-api) to
    create multiple document variations from data and extract the data
    merge tags.

-   Custom Capabilities to do almost anything you can do in InDesign
    using a custom script. It works with the [Custom Script API](#how-tos)

-   [Status API](#linktostatus) to get the latest status event of a capability execution.
