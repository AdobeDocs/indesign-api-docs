# Using Webhooks

InDesign APIs events provide all the job processing details, similar to
those shown in the [status
calls]() of InDesign APIs. However, InDesign API events are more comprehensive and
real-time, unlike the status calls, which only include `"not-started"`,
`"running"`,`"completed"`, and `"failed"` statuses.

Please refer to the [InDesign APIs
Webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/events/docs/guides/using/idcs/idcs-events-data-stream-setup/)
for a detailed guide on setting up webhooks.
